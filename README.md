# Food social app
This is a simple social app for food lovers.
It's open source app for educational purposes only.

## To-dos

- Users => DONE
- Posts => In progress
- Votes => Pending
- Comments => Pending
- Recipes/Guides => Pending
- Requests/Questions => Pending
- Following/Link/Friendship => Pending
- Messages => Maybe
- ...and more to come

## Goal

Basically users will be able to write posts about how they are hungry or full, or just about how they feel like they really want to commit suicide. They will also be able to post guides and recipes on how to prepare various meals. There should be also ASK-ANSWER Quora-like system which allows users to gather various information about cooking and food itself. Maybe it would be useful to add functionality for some social stuff. I mean just how lame will you feel when children ask you where you met their mother? On a social food app? God please.
